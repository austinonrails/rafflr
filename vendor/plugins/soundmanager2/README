SoundManager2
=============

This is a wrapper around Scott Schill's SoundManager2 Javascript API 
(http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/).  

* Home page: http://soundmanager2.rubyforge.org
* Project page: http://rubyforge.org/projects/soundmanager2
* Repository: http://soundmanager2.rubyforge.org/svn

Use the supplied generator to install the SoundManager2 Javascript and Flash
files in your Rails app like this:

  ./script/generate sound_manager2
  
This will create the following files:
  public/soundmanager2.swf
  public/javascripts/soundmanager2.js
  public/javascripts/soundmanager2-jsmin.js
  public/javascripts/soundmanager2-rails.js
  public/images/SoundManager2/pause-control.gif
  public/images/SoundManager2/play-control.gif

Then, to add basic play/stop functionality to your view, add the following to 
your ERB files:

<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>
<% 
  sounds = [
    ["sound1", "http://url/to/sound1.mp3"],
    ["sound2", url_for(:controller => "sounds", :action => "listen", :id => "2")],
  ]  
%>
<%= initialize_sounds(sounds) %>

<div>Play sound #1: <%= toggle_sound "sound1" %></div>
<div>Play sound #2: <%= toggle_sound "sound2" %></div>

And that's it!  You can use as much or as little of SoundManager2's API 
directly, but I hope to add a complete API wrapper eventually.
